# Crowdfunding_ETL

Summary
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Used Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and a PostgreSQL database:

Extracted and transformed data from a large Excel file into smaller CSV files
Created a PostgreSQL database and tables by using an ERD
Loaded CSV files into a database
Ran queries to retrieve data and generate reports for stakeholders


This classwork ETL mini project skills on a large dataset. Python was used to extract and transform, SQL is used to load and query the data.
